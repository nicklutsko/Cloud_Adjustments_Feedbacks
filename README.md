Analysis scripts for "Correlation Between Cloud Adjustments and Cloud Feedbacks Responsible for Larger Range of Climate Sensitivities in CMIP6" by Lutsko et al.

Contains the following files:
* CMIP_cloud_adjustments_feedbacks.ipynb (bulk of the analysis)
* Cloud adjustment maps.ipynb (makes the maps of cloud adjustments, including the adjusted low cloud adjustment maps)
* Sample Cloud Adjustment Calculation.ipynb (shows how cloud adjustments were calculated)
* new_CMIP5_data.txt & new_CMIP5_data.txt (contains forcing, feedback and adjustment data for the two model ensembles)
* CMIP5_net_adj.npy, CMIP5_lw_adj.npy, CMIP5_sw_adj.npy, CMIP6_net_adj.npy, CMIP6_lw_adj.npy, CMIP6_sw_adj.npy (lat x lon cloud adjustment fields)
* CMIP5_adjusted_low_cloud.npy & CMIP6_adjusted_low_cloud.npy (lat x lon low cloud adjustment fields)

The Cloud Controlling Factor (CCF) analysis was done by Tim Myers (timothy.myers@noaa.gov ) and Matt Luongo (mluongo@ucsd.edu), please contact them for code (much of it is already available on Tim's website). The results are given in the CMIP_cloud_adjustments_feedbacks notebook.
